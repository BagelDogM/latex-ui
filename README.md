# latex_ui
Latex editor with a UI for use by non-technical editors, that compiles to regular latex code. Created initially for minute taking, but customisation for any use is planned in the future.

> Frontend: HTML & CSS with Tailwind and vanilla JavaScript <br>
> Backend: Python with Flask

To use yourself, run `npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/static/input.css -o ./src/static/output.css` in the project's directory to generate the appropriate CSS. Then run `app.py` and access at `127.0.0.1:8080`
